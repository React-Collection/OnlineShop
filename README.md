# Online Shop - React Project

## Project Overview

This project is an **Online Shop** web application, built with modern frontend technologies such as **React**, **Vite**, **SCSS**, and **React Router DOM**. The application is designed to showcase products, allow users to browse categories, view product details, and manage their shopping cart. It can be extended to include checkout functionalities, user authentication, and more advanced e-commerce features.

The project structure follows best practices in React development, including reusable components, state management, and routing. Styles are managed using SCSS for better control over design and maintainability. **Vite** is used as the build tool, providing a faster development environment with modern tooling.

## Technologies Used

### 1. **React**
   - React is the core framework used to build the user interface of the application. It's a powerful library for creating interactive UIs with reusable components.

### 2. **Vite**
   - Vite is a modern build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It serves the app in development with blazing fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and builds the production bundle with optimized configurations.

### 3. **SCSS (Sass)**
   - SCSS is used for styling the components. SCSS provides advanced styling capabilities such as variables, mixins, and nesting, making it easier to manage the design of the project.

### 4. **React Router DOM**
   - React Router DOM is used for navigation between different pages such as the product listing page, product detail page, and the cart page. It provides an efficient way to implement client-side routing in React applications.
